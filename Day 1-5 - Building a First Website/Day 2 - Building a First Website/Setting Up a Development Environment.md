## Why do we need code editors?

```In other words, a code editor is a developer tool which logs text and does other things which help devs enhance that text in ways which are helpful for the uses of programming. For this reason, using a reliable code editor can help a dev write code more quickly, more efficiently, more smoothly, and more successfully.```

## Which text editor is best for web development?

```Visual Studio Code. Visual Studio Code is an official text editor for web development from Microsoft, which explains why it is one of the most popular solutions for web developers.``` 

## Why VS code is the best editor?

```Using Electron, VS Code combines web technologies such as JavaScript and Node. js with the speed and flexibility of native apps. VS Code uses a newer, faster version of the same industrial-strength HTML-based editor that has powered the "Monaco" cloud editor, Internet Explorer's F12 Tools, and other projects.```
