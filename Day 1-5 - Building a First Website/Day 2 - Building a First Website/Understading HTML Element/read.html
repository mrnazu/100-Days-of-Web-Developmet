<!-- Day 2 -->

<!-- HTML is a "Markup Language" 
    it Used to structure and the page--> 

<!-- Understading HTML Elements -->

<h1>Hello world</h1> <!--  HTML Element -->

<!-- Elements "tell" the browser wich kind of content is displayed 
    like=> #headings, #text #images, #lists, #buttons....-->


<!-- <h1> and </h1> => Called HTML Tag , 
    Hello world => Called Elemetn Content-->

<p>This is simple text.</p>

<img src="element.png" alt="about elements">

<!-- An opening tag begins a section of page content, 
    and a closing tag ends it. 
    For example, to markup a section of text as a paragraph, 
    you would open the paragraph with an opening paragraph tag 
    #<p> and close it with a closing paragraph tag #</p> 
    (closing tags always proceed the element with a /). -->


 
<!-- Which HTML Elements Exist?

    cuz there are a lot of things you can discribe.

-->


<!-- Why HTML Elements? 

    without extra annotation,content often has no clear meaning
    
    for example
    
    Hello world! => can you tell that this should be a title

    <h1>Hello world</h1> => with <h1> tags, it's absolutely clear
    that it should be a title 

    it's like writing just plain, unformatted text in word
-->

<!-- All HTML elements can have attributes · 
    Attributes provide additional information about elements · 
    Attributes are always specified in the start tag -->
